# Save Image as Type - Firefox Extension

## Overview
Save Image as Type is a Firefox extension that adds a **Save Image as PNG / JPG / WebP** option to the right-click context menu of images. This allows users to quickly save images in their preferred format without needing additional conversion tools.

This is a Firefox-compatible port of [Save-Image-as-Type](https://github.com/image4tools/Save-Image-as-Type) with modifications for better compatibility and organization.
